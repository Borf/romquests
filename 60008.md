- Dialog: (5097)[c][ffff00]Rekenber's Supply[-][/c] still hasn't arrived.
- Dialog: (503415)I'm very concerned they might have been attacked by monsters. Adventurer, patrol the west. - Options: No problem.
- Dialog: (503504)However, it's still a bit too dangerous for you to fight the monsters in the west. So you'd better [c][ffff00]make adequate preparations[/c] before heading there.
- Dialog: (503416)By the way, adventurer, if you come across something shiny on your patrol path, you can tap on it.
- Dialog: (503417)There is a collection of strange and unusual stories about the world and some interesting requests. When you've satisfied their requests, you'll get some extremely memorable [c][fff00]Collectibles[-][/c] as souvenirs.
- Dialog: (503418)I'm just passing this on to you. Now go ahead and patrol the west side, please!

- Dialog: (3040)Did the garrison send you to help us? You're just in time!
- Dialog: (3041)Unbelievable! [c][ffff00]A group of Rockers[-][/c] robbed us of some of the materials we were transporting!
- Dialog: (3042)They acted so fast, and slipped away as soon as they took our stuff! We don't have enough people. I had some of my men chase after the group to the west, but there's an even larger group here! What are we going to do? It's so frustrating! - Options: Let me take care of it!
- Dialog: (3043)Really? That would be great! Those Rockers can be vicious, so be careful! Once you [c][ffff00]catch up to the Rockers and recover the materials, take them straight to the Garrison Camp[-][/c]!
- Dialog: (503389)Having said that, I wonder if you've paid attention to the skills you've acquired. They can help you enhance your existing skills and, in turn, learn higher-level skills. That pile of Rockers is quite annoying. What about adding skill points before you go? - Options: OK

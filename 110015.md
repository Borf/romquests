- Dialog: (96704)The core of the main underwater seal has been damaged. If the enormous energy contained in the two mirror points can't be absorbed by the core, it will become extremely unstable. Which might lead to an explosion that would destroy the Underwater Cave, and even all of Byalan Island!
- Dialog: (96705)I need to hurry to the [c][ffff00]right second mirror point[-][/c] to repair the seal enchantment there. I'll meet you there!  - Options: I'll leave right now!

- Dialog: (96706)Good job! Luckily enough, I managed to find some Sapphire Crystals on the way here. I can use them to repair the seal enchantment. But the purity of these crystals is too high. I'll need to neutralize and dilute them a bit.

- Dialog: (401910)Uhh, it's the adventurer. Are you interested in taking a look at the orchestra contest?
- Dialog: (401911)The Wind Whisper Orchestra will select new members in Eclage every three star years.
- Dialog: (401912)We are now having the contest of instrument players.
- Dialog: (401913)(Whispering) The selection should have been put on hold after what happened this year. - Options: After what happened?
- Dialog: (401914)(Looks at you and ignores you)... But the Holy Lady thinks that music can calm everyone down from sadness. So the selection was still held normally.
- Dialog: (401915)lets change a topic. There are so many Elves that want to join the orchestra this year... I donâ€™t know which one to pick. - Options: Why?
- Dialog: (401916)Of course it is because the orchestra regularly plays for the Holy Lady and Oracle. This is a supreme honor.
- Dialog: (401917)Of course, being able to get close to the Holy Lady should be the reason why the male Elves are eager to sign up...

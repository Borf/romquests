- Dialog: (503443)It's you who are going to set off for the bottom of the sea, right? - Options: You're right
- Dialog: (503444)Then you first have to take this boat to Byalan Island, a small island with an entrance to an underwater cave. I usually travel back and forth between Izlude and Byalan by transporting cargo.
- Dialog: (503445)But before you head off to Byalan Island, I'd like to introduce another magical place, the Endless Tower - Options: Endless Tower?
- Dialog: (503446)That's right, this is the [c][ffff00]Endless Tower of Trials[-][/c] built by the most famous craftsman in the world!
- Dialog: (503447)It was supposed to be a path that led to Valhalla Gods' Dwelling. But after the Ragnarok, the gods fell and the Endless Tower was destroyed. The craftsman could not accept this fact and continued to build something on the ruins in his madness.
- Dialog: (503448)But one day, this craftsman mysteriously disappeared all of a sudden! Strange sounds began to rise from the ruins as if a formless power was repairing the tower. - Options: ... A bit scary
- Dialog: (503449)What is even more bizarre is that the space inside Endless Tower has become very unstable since then. But there is a very powerful force in this instability. And the adventurers who can pass the trial of this power are by no means ordinary people. Thus, Endless Tower gradually became a proving ground for adventurers to prove their strength and increase their power. Have a go at it if you got time! - Options: Understood!
- Dialog: (503450)I've said so much in the heat of the moment. You'd better get on with the important things first! ! Hurry and go! !

- Dialog: (82393)Before, Glast Heim was once flourishing and prosperous. It was nicknamed the heart of the continent.
- Dialog: (82394)But now, here is nothing but broken walls left. The history behind these ruinsÂ remains unknown.
- Dialog: (82395)All I can tell you is the undead here are completely different from their peers in Payon. I should say they are way more advanced!
- Dialog: (82396)They have occupied the Glast Heim for a long time. I'm stationed here with the Crest Alliance Army by His Majesty.
- Dialog: (82397)I'll figure out the secret of the undead here so the alliance can enter the Glast Heim and solve the myths under the ruins.

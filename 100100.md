- Dialog: (96675)I'm not sure about the details. The Elder of the Mage Guild took some mages underwater to investigate. Hurry to the [c][ffff00]Underwater Cave[-][/c] and find [c][ffff00]Elder Keiler[-][/c] to learn more, and see what help you can provide. 
- Dialog: (503452)By the way, the bottom of the sea is very dangerous. I have a dish here for you to deal with crises ahead. It will keep you safe. - Options: Understood!
- Dialog: (503453)Whenever you come across a [c][ffff00]Food Merchant[-][/c] on your future travels, you can buy similar dishes from her. Oh yeah, they also seem to have [c][fff00]Free Tastings[-][/c] event every day, which is sweet!

- Dialog: (96676)[c][ffff00][PlayerName][-][/c], Brenna has told me about you. Thank you for all your help! - Options: You're welcome!
- Dialog: (503505)However, it's still a bit too dangerous for you to fight those monsters. So you'd better [c][ffff00]make adequate preparations[/c] before heading there.
- Dialog: (96677)Things are fairly serious this time, and it looks like we need your help once more. Behind me is one of the ancient seals that has kept Morroc suppressed. At the time, it was only with the aid of Strouf's power that such a strong seal barrier was created. Previously, West Gate and the sunken ship area had a series of disturbances, and we determined them all to be related to a loosening of the seal! 
- Dialog: (96678)Even as one of the Elders of the Mage Guild, it seems unbelievable to me. It's been so many years, yet the seal has remained in perfect condition. We need to come up with a way to repair it. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable!

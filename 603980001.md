- Dialog: (485188)Pioneers of the Meteor Forest built the Heavenly Derivative Wheel, guiding the energy of the sun, the moon, and stars here and making it circulate in the Meteor Forest, which benefits the Star Emperor's cultivation a lot!
- Dialog: (485189)There are four divine mirrors scattered in the Meteor Forest: Divine Sun Mirror, Divine Moon Mirror, Divine Star Mirror, and Divine Rainbow Mirror.
- Dialog: (485190)These divine mirrors can not only guide the stars' energy but also engrave and reproduce the things they reflect. Perhaps with the power of the divine mirrors, we can fix the Heavenly Derivative Wheel.

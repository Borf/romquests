- Dialog: (9587)Our Ugarte family has one of the oldest histories of any family in the land.
- Dialog: (9588)Legend says that before the Twilight of the Gods occurred, our brave, young ancestor Mike Ugarte practiced his combat techniques in a swamp full of monsters. He once saved a "person" whose skin was as white as a corpse, who had black hair, a black beard, a deformed body, short legs, long hands, a big head, and a scarred face. 
- Dialog: (9589)The kind Ugarte led him out of the dangerous swamp, and spent a long time healing the wounds the monsters had inflicted on the man.
- Dialog: (9590)After the wounds had healed, the man quietly left while Mike was sleeping. Before he left, knowing that Ugarte had taken such good care of him, the guest left behind a thick piece of parchment and a letter. 
- Dialog: (9591)Once Ugarte woke up, he read the letter the guest had left, and discovered that his guest was a dwarf bound to the service of the Gods. He had forged many powerful weapons for them, Including Odin's Eternal Spear. 
- Dialog: (9592)Recalling Ugarte's care, he left behind a smithing scroll written in Runic, as well as a branch from the World Tree. He told Mike that major chaos would soon erupt, and he hoped that he could pass down this art throughout the land. Forever. 
- Dialog: (9593)Not long later, just as the dwarf said, disaster struck. But, my ancestor who was prepared, gathered some food and avoided the fires of war.
- Dialog: (9594)In the following years he remained underground, studying various smithing techniques. The weapons and armor he made was stronger than anything else. Magic flowed through them, possessing them with great strength. 
- Dialog: (9595)After the war, a new order was established. He established himself amongst the survivors for his strong smithing techniques, creating a powerful family that has been around for a millennium--the Ugarte family.

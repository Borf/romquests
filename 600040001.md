- Dialog: (81971)You might not be able to sense it. But for a Mage, These chaotic magical waves are very disturbing.
- Dialog: (81972)An ancient book in the Geffen Library mentioned that the War of Gods ended with the defeat of Yimir the ancestor of all giants. His body fell apart and the parts were scattered all over the world.
- Dialog: (81973)And this is where Yimir's heart landed. - Options: Are you sure?
- Dialog: (81974)Hmm? Are you questioning me? Isn't this chaotic mana a convincing proof?
- Dialog: (81975)Only the Yimir Heart can mess mana to this degree. The gians' power is different from the gods'.
- Dialog: (81976)I guess the heart Shard bearing the giant ancestor's strength fell on this peaceful city.
- Dialog: (81977)I don't know what happened but there's no sign of a frontal collision from the Yimir Heart or this land would be burnt.
- Dialog: (81978)I'm still here looking for the Yimir Heart. If a wicked hand finds it, the consequences would be unpredictable.

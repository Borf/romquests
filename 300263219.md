- Dialog: (83453)Don't consider the eggs in the sewer harmless. Last time an adventurer broke some eggs out of curiosity...
- Dialog: (83549)The Thief Bug Male ★ jumped out from one of the egg. That is way more troublesome than regular Thief Bugs Male! However, the adventurer killed the bug after running ten blocks and found some extremely rare materials unexpectedly. Ha-hah... This doesn't happen often. Not every egg can hatch a Thief Bug Male ★. Would you like to try?

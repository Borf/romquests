- Dialog: (82768)Hyegun is causing trouble in the Payon Cave again. He's summoned a bunch of invisible monsters. The Commander is very concerned.
- Dialog: (82769)Fortunately the monster researcher from Prontera told us he brought his [c][ffff00]Phantom Camera[-][/c] into the cave one day to [c][ffff00]take photo of those purple ghosts[-][/c] and by chance saw the actual monster hidden inside those ghosts.
- Dialog: (82770)Some adventurers have entered the first and second levels of the Payon Cave, using this method to look for [c][ffff00]Sohees[-][/c] and [c][ffff00]Horongs[-][/c] inside those ghosts. They've obtained some rare materials from them.
- Dialog: (82771)If you are interested, give it a try. Those ghosts don't show up often. You must be patient.
- Dialog: (82772)If you don't know how to use the "Phantom Camera", visit Roland in Prontera to master the skill, "Phantom Camera".

- Dialog: (3101)But then again, there are indeed some disturbances around [c][ffff00]Izlude[-][/c], which is also why the Mages Guild and the Garrison suddenly gathered here. Truth be told, I do want you to leave immediately to help my friends.
- Dialog: (3102)But before that, would you please go and check up on [c][ffff00]Shapley[-][/c], an old friend of mine? She has been worrying about her son lately. Shapley has helped us a lot in our affairs in Izlude, so I'd like to do something for her in return...


### Step 1

- Visit NPC 1100, Shapley

- Dialog: (3104)Welcome to [c][ffff00]Izlude[-][/c]. The island's residents maintain the surrounding areas, and are also tasked with defending the nearby waters. The island might look small, but there are enough people to make things festive here.
- Dialog: (3105)Recently, the [c][ffff00]Mage Guild[-][/c] and [c][ffff00]Prontera Garrison[-][/c] have suddenly come to the island, and the island has been filled with Mages... My son, [c][ffff00]Laurell Weinder[-][/c], has always dreamed about becoming a Mage, but hasn't been able to find anyone to recommend him. - Options: Tell me the situation.
- Dialog: (3106)Oh right, since you're an adventurer from Prontera, you must have some experience with Mages! Could you recommend my son? He's really gifted! 
- Dialog: (3107)Sure thing. Do you know where the [c][ffff00]Mages[-][/c] are right now?
- Dialog: (3108)You can ask my son [c][ffff00]Laurell Weinder[-][/c]. He is in the garden over there... (I hope I can make my son's dream come true this time. You can do it!)

- Visit NPC 1111, Laurell Weinder

- Dialog: (3112)I've looked up to those powerful Mages ever since I was little. I want to be one! I want to be just like them!
- Dialog: (3113)Ever since I graduated from the Cryptura Academy, I've wanted to join the Mage Guild. But, since we're not close to Prontera, nobody in my family knows any Mages that can give me a letter of recommendation. There's nothing I can do!
- Dialog: (3114)My dream has never changed, I've just never had the chance to make it come true! I just saw some powerful Mages by the sea, and I quietly followed them. - Options: Tell me the situation.


### Step 3

- Visit NPC 1110, Ryder

- Dialog: (3116)Who's there? (muttering attack magic)
- Dialog: (3117)Ah! I didn't mean any harm! I'm an adventurer from Prontera...
- Dialog: (3118)Oh, it's [c][ffff00][PlayerName][-][/c]. I've heard Master Brenna talk about you. My name is [c][ffff00]Ryder[-][/c]. Brenna detected that there was a problem with the sea from the Floating Gardens, so I've been testing the energy waves of these waters.
- Dialog: (3119)I can conjecture that it was caused by the loosening of an underwater seal, but because the seal is in the Underwater Cave, the entire Mage Guild is stumped on what to do next. We're so busy, and we don't have enough people!
- Dialog: (503462)But even so, I have to be careful in selecting candidates who can become Mages. Let's start with the testing of your abilities first - [c][ffff00]adventurer[-][/c].
- Dialog: (503463)Of course, don't you still have to go to the bottom of the sea to help my other friends? I have to make sure you're really up to it! I don't want to put you at risk, nor do I want my companions to take the risk of saving you in danger. Then please eliminate these monsters first!

- Dialog: (503464)Not bad, adventurer!
- Dialog: (3120)I see. I know a young man who has always looked up to the Mage Guild. He's diligent and smart, and wants to join your Guild to learn how to become a powerful Mage. 
- Dialog: (3121)Hm... Well since you're recommending him... Alright. But I still have to inspect these waters, and when I'm done, I have to immediately head back to the [c][ffff00]Geffen Guild HQ[-][/c], so I don't have much time to wait for him. Why don't you tell him to come, and I can take him with me back to Geffen!

- Dialog: (311864)Huh? Let me see... Are you an adventurer?
- Dialog: (311874)Sigh... That apprentice is hopeless. If her master doesn't turn a profit, will she be able to earn money for my business in the future?
- Dialog: (311875)You can never have enough money. Right...
- Dialog: (311876)Anyway... Welcome to Lighthalzen! If you get the chance, please be sure to take advantage of my services.
- Dialog: (311865)Has another adventurer arrived? Interestingâ€¦
- Dialog: (311866)Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Gerald. I'm a detective.
- Dialog: (311867)If there's anything you need investigating, I'm your man. I don't care whose entrustment it is, I'll accept it. - Options: What do you investigate?
- Dialog: (311869)Haha! There's no secret that Gerald can't find out!
- Dialog: (311870)Of course, it takes money... Enough money for the task in hand... Understand? - Options: Are you short on funds?
- Dialog: (311871)Short on funds? No, what are you thinking?
- Dialog: (311872)Making money is my hobby. Anyway... Did you see that girl with a serious face around here?
- Dialog: (311873)She's my useless apprentice, Kim. Did you see that? She was glaring at me again just now!

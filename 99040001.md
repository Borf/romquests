- Dialog: (3901)Got it. You're not the first man to deliver a message for [c][ffff00]Chris[-][/c]. He should make time to come by himself.
- Dialog: (3902)For the newcomers' safety, we've handed out an Eggshell Hat to everyone. It's easy for him to say this, as now we're in an awful shortage of [c][ffff00]Eden Team Eggshells[-][/c]. We barely have any left.
- Dialog: (3903)… I have one. I hope it helps.
- Dialog: (3904)Unfortunately, it doesn't. All the Eden Team Eggshells are disinfected and brand new. Yours is so worn out. How can I use it?

- Dialog: (3909)It's our duty.
- Dialog: (3910)Tell me. How can I help you? I'd go through fire and water for you!
- Dialog: (3911)Not that serious… You don't have to go through fire and water. I want to buy five [c][ffff00]Eggshells[-][/c].
- Dialog: (3912)Eggshell hats? Haha… Eggshells? Haha.

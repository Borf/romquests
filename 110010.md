- Dialog: (96686)It seems that we need some elements to strengthen the enchantment energy and help maintain the seal. Thankfully, I've brought some magic ore with me, but it can only be used for spells when mixed. I've got it! [c][ffff00]Marinas drop their tentacles[-][/c], and can be used as mixture materials. Can you help me collect some? 
- Dialog: (96687)The Elder has ordered me to go to the [c][ffff00]first mirror point to the right[-][/c] and repair the seal enchantment there. I'll need your help again. I'll be waiting for you there!  - Options: I'll be there soon!

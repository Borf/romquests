- Dialog: (65080)If somebody strikes up conversation with you in the middle of the forest, do not heed them! - Options: Why?
- Dialog: (65089)What’s even more scary is... - Options: What happened?
- Dialog: (65090)Under the light of the full moon, his body began to transform. I could hear his bones cracking as they changed shape.
- Dialog: (65091)His body grew with fur all over near instantly, his teeth fell out with much blood and were replaced with a set of long sharp teeth.
- Dialog: (65092)Letting out a howl, he turned into the Grandma Wolf in my grandma's clothing! I feared that he had already ended my grandmother's life long ago. - Options: Pound...
- Dialog: (65093)What happened next is too difficult for me to recount. If you had been eaten alive, you'd understand my pain. - Options: Pat head
- Dialog: (65094)I thought death would be my liberation. I never thought that the Grandma Wolf would appear in the Town of the Dead.
- Dialog: (65095)The only thing I want now is revenge! Will you help me? - Options: I will help you!
- Dialog: (65096)The Grandma Wolf has a weakness, and we can take advantage of it. - Options: What weakness?
- Dialog: (65097)Its ears are terribly sensitive. A shrill, screeching noise will drive it mad! - Options: I understand.
- Dialog: (65098)There is a kind of Screeching Monster in the south-west part of the Misty Forest. If it takes damage it will let out an ear-piercing screech!
- Dialog: (65081)Haven't you heard the tale of the wolf grandmother? - Options: Have not heard about it
- Dialog: (65099)If you can defeat 5 Screeching Monsters, the loud, shrill noises they make will surely cause pain to the Grandma Wolf! Then I’m sure the Grandma Wolf will show itself in the Misty Forest! - Options: I understand
- Dialog: (65082)One day, mom told me to bring some wine and cake to my sick grandmother. - Options: And then?
- Dialog: (65083)On the forest path appeared a charming man who began talking with me kindly.
- Dialog: (65084)Because I was feeling lonely, I decided to go together with him. We went our separate ways at the crossroads leading to my grandmother’s house. - Options: And then?
- Dialog: (65085)I went up the path to my grandmother’s house and saw her lying in bed, but she seemed bizarrely different!
- Dialog: (65086)Her voice had turned deep and raspy, and her shoulders were big and broad!
- Dialog: (65087)I sensed something wasn’t right and turned to run out of the house, but then she leaped right out of bed and chased me!
- Dialog: (65088)Then, under the moonlight outside I saw her clearly. I realized that it was actually the man who had accompanied me earlier!

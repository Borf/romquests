- Dialog: (83455)The Labyrinth Forest is full of unknown beings. I've been working on the aboriginal creatures. Recently I discovered a special Creamy creature. I call it Creamy★.
- Dialog: (83551)I intended to catch a few for my research but they usually move rapidly. It's really hard to catch them. Sigh... I believe these Creamy★s have more precious materials to collect. Adventurer, don't miss your chance if you encounter them.

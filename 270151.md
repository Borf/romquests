- Dialog: (86307)A mortal Brave will enter Valhalla built by almighty Odin and become an Epic Spirit who fights for gods and mortals.
- Dialog: (86316)The purpose of this is to prevent the catastrophic Ragnarok from happening again.This world needs more Braves after all!
- Dialog: (86308)Epic Spirits have long been safeguarding the Divine Court and the Sky Castle. They are worthy of their title.
- Dialog: (86309)The majority of Epic Spirits died in the Ragnarok, Leaving Valhalla empty.
- Dialog: (86310)When the remaining gods got the news that the next Ragnarok is brewing, they decided to make preparations in advance and restore Valhalla to its former glory.
- Dialog: (86311)The power of Epic Spirit is that of the dead, a "gift from gods" mortals receive after their death.
- Dialog: (86312)Mortals now can hardly handle the power that rivals an Epic Spirit because their bodies cannot withstand the power of the dead.This power will cause their body to collapse and die in the end.
- Dialog: (86313)But the gods still believe mortals have infinite possibilities. They managed to improve the constitution of "the power of Epic Spirit" and created a new "divine power" which even mortals can control with ease.
- Dialog: (86314)Now valkyries have settled in guilds where mortal Braves gather to help and select outstanding heroes to become the reserve force of Valhalla.
- Dialog: (86315)Gods will gift "divine power"to members of Valhalla's reserve force. This power can make a mortal go beyond the limits of their race and become as powerful as an Epic Spirit.

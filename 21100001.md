- Dialog: (96167)You look troubled. Is something wrong?
- Dialog: (96176)Really? Thank you so much! I have to clear out three types of monsters: [c][ffff00]Tarou, Thief Bugs, and Spores, and we need to eliminate 10 of each[-][/c]! - Options: I'll take care of it!
- Dialog: (96168)Oh, you've noticed. There's been lots of monsters in the Sewer lately, and the Army Guard has been busy clearing them out. I haven't had time to tell anyone about my problems...
- Dialog: (96169)True, why would a woman volunteer to go with the Army Guard into the Sewer. Do you have some sort of fetish! 
- Dialog: (96170)Ew, no! It's because... Because... [c][ffff00]Rahm[-][/c] volunteered too.
- Dialog: (96171)What does that have to do with you?
- Dialog: (96172)It... it has a lot to do with me! Don't tell anyone else, but Rahm and I were best friends growing up. He always took care of me, and he was handsome, but I don't think he matured as fast, emotionally.
- Dialog: (96173)With the monsters in the Sewer, Rahm bravely volunteered to help everyone. I... I just wanted to spend some more time with him, so I volunteered too...
- Dialog: (96174)I'm actually a scaredy cat. The first time I saw real monsters in the Sewer, I was terrified! But as long as Rahm is by my side, I can take it. If we had more people help clear out the Sewer, I'd be able to go back to the city and go out with Rahm! 
- Dialog: (96175)Ah, the power of love! That was brave of you! Alright, let me help you!

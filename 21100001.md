- Dialog: (96167)You look troubled. Is something wrong?
- Dialog: (96176)Really? Thank you so much! I have to clear out three types of monsters: [c][ffff00]Tarou, Thief Bugs, and Spores, and we need to eliminate 10 of each[-][/c]! - Options: I'll take care of it!
- Dialog: (96168)Oh, you've noticed. There's been lots of monsters in the Sewer lately, and the Army Guard has been busy clearing them out. I haven't had time to tell anyone about my problems...
- Dialog: (96169)True, why would a woman volunteer to go with the Army Guard into the Sewer. Do you have some sort of fetish! 
- Dialog: (96170)Ew, no! It's because... Because... [c][ffff00]Rahm[-][/c] volunteered too.
- Dialog: (96171)What does that have to do with you?
- Dialog: (96172)It... it has a lot to do with me! Don't tell anyone else, but Rahm and I were best friends growing up. He always took care of me, and he was handsome, but I don't think he matured as fast, emotionally.
- Dialog: (96173)With the monsters in the Sewer, Rahm bravely volunteered to help everyone. I... I just wanted to spend some more time with him, so I volunteered too...
- Dialog: (96174)I'm actually a scaredy cat. The first time I saw real monsters in the Sewer, I was terrified! But as long as Rahm is by my side, I can take it. If we had more people help clear out the Sewer, I'd be able to go back to the city and go out with Rahm! 
- Dialog: (96175)Ah, the power of love! That was brave of you! Alright, let me help you!

- Dialog: (96180)That was amazing! Thanks to you, we were able to complete our duties ahead of time!
- Dialog: (96181)You're welcome! But since you've quietly done so much for Rahm, you should work up the courage to let him know how you feel. You have to fight for your love. Don't miss out on your chance...
- Dialog: (96182)Mhm! That makes sense! Once Rahm is finished with his duties, I'll find the right time to tell him how I feel! I love him so much!
- Dialog: (96183)I'm sure you will make a lovely couple! Remember to invite me to your wedding!

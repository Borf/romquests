- Dialog: (120001)Today, let's talk about the greatest blacksmith in Prontera: Hollgrehenn!
- Dialog: (120002)Hollgrehenn believed that his skills had surpassed his teacher's, and became increasingly arrogant.
- Dialog: (120003)Upon discovering his student's arrogance, Hayward said, "Young Hollgrehenn, you must know of a beast in a far-off land known as a Garm."
- Dialog: (120004)"Its fur shines like gold, Its bones sparkle like crystals. No sword can pierce its hide, and it is stronger than any other beast."
- Dialog: (120005)"If you forge a weapon that can cut away its fur, then you may use your pride and become your own master."
- Dialog: (120006)Hollgrehenn confidently beat his chest, saying, "No problem! I will behead it myself!"
- Dialog: (120007)He began to gather all sorts of rare materials, from asteroids from space to ore from the heart of the planet. It took him three years to forge the perfect weapon. Hollgrehenn looked at it, enchanted it, and was filled with confidence. 
- Dialog: (120008)I'll leave the story there for now. Can you buy a piece of [c][ffff00]Blue Gemstone[-][/c] for me?  - Options: I'll go right now.

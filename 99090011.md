- Dialog: (1322)In the past, [c][ffff00]Prontera[-][/c] wasn't as peaceful as it is now. There would be frequent monster attacks, and the Kingdom Guards were constantly kept busy.
- Dialog: (1323)In order to solve the problems of its residents, [c][ffff00]Prontera[-][/c] put up a large wooden board, and had everyone stick their problems to it. When the Kingdom Guards saw, they would collect the problems and solve them all at once.
- Dialog: (1324)After a while, some adventurers would take down the posts and help the residents, so the Kingdom Guards didn't have to work as hard. Security is much better now.
- Dialog: (1325)People will still post problems they need solved on the board. It seems to have become a custom. But now, everyone is living peaceful, easy lives, so there are few people willing to help others for free. That's why these quests all seem to have great rewards.
- Dialog: (1326)Of course, with rewards come people who rely on the rewards. It seems that the royal family allows this form to exist. So if you are running low on cash, adventurer, maybe you should go take a look!

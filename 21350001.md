- Dialog: (1303)Shh, let me tell you a secret! I have some good items that I got trading someone else before. Don't underestimate these [c][ffff00]Dead Branches[-][/c]. I can feel the magic they let off, like they are quietly calling something...
- Dialog: (1304)One of them broke when I was moving some merchandise a few days ago, and it summoned a terrifying monster! It was so scary. Luckily, there was a Knight Squad patrolling the area nearby, and they took care of it. 
- Dialog: (1305)These Dead Branches are precious, but they're too dangerous to keep around. Since I need to get rid of them, I'll give them to you for cheap! Collect some [c][ffff00]Mucus[-][/c]. I'll give you [c][ffff00]3 Dead Branches[-][/c] for [c][ffff00]10 Mucus[-][/c]. I've heard that Willows drop [c][ffff00]Mucus[-][/c]. Come back to me when you have enough!

- Dialog: (83454)Recently, I have noticed some changes on my comrades. Maybe the underwater mana shock has left some impact on them. Sometimes there are Marc★, Obeaune★, and Hydra★. They appear the same with their normal selves but are actually much more violent.
- Dialog: (83550)Adventurer, If you are to continue advancing, please be careful. They are hidden among their peers. There are not many of them but they do appear once in a while.

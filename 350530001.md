- Dialog: (132150)The appearance of this sort of humanoid monster is an amazing discovery! His Majesty the King is very interested in this. 
- Dialog: (132151)Humanoid monsters typically have four limbs, Like we do. They walk and attack the same as we do, and they even possess a certain intelligence. 
- Dialog: (132152)This is a major trait of humanoid monsters--they understand how to use weapons and fire, and they even know how to build crude residences.
- Dialog: (132153)But the extremely aggressive Orcs remind me of berserk monsters, so based on my research, Orcs have a certain level of intelligence.
- Dialog: (132154)Right, They are monsters, but they don't have any Jellopys in their bodies. Strange, Isn't it?
- Dialog: (132155)The strangest thing is that most of the weapons Orcs used in the past were made from stone or wood, but recently, we have seen some Orcs using iron weapons. 
- Dialog: (132156)As far as I know, Orcs don't possess the smelting techniques to make iron weapons.
- Dialog: (132157)His Majesty the King feels that if this sort of monster grows in number, it will pose an enormous threat to the kingdom, so he has sent the Monster Research Organization here to study the Orcs. 
- Dialog: (132158)The Monster Research Organization will do everything we can to find the source of this sort of humanoid monster and alleviate the concerns of the King!

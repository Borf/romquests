- Dialog: (9954)Long ago, the kobolds were like goblins. They were monsters, but they had intelligence that was different from most monsters.
- Dialog: (9955)Now, Possibly because of Morroc's curse, the kobolds have begun to lose their intelligence and wantonly attack people.
- Dialog: (9956)Even the Wild Roses that the kobolds raised in pens have become more violent. They even attack the kobolds, which have made some kobolds who haven't lost their intelligence hate Wild Roses to their core.
- Dialog: (9957)Their berserk nature poses a serious threat to people who pass them, and His Majesty the King will never allow this sort of thing to happen, so we will do our best to study them and find their weakness!

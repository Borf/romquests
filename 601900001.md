- Dialog: (101820)The Magma Dungeon have become a fearful place for the Adventurers with their horrible heat.
- Dialog: (101821)The monsters born in the caves grew rapidly with the power of lava and flames. They were originally active, but recently they are very hostile to human, often attacking innocent Adventurers.
- Dialog: (101822)Because they grew up beside the magma, the flame power of these monsters is very strong. The common Adventurers can't defend the attack of the monsters. This makes people more and more afraid of Magma Dungeon and it has become a forbidden place for human.
- Dialog: (101823)Monster Research Organization will never allow this, I will try my best to study them and find the root cause of their attacks on human!

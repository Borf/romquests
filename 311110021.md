- Dialog: (120068)A dark wind blew, and a deep voice echoed through the village; "I accept your tribute, and shall return in one decade."

- Dialog: (120070)"Who allowed you to look directly at us? You have besmirched our dignity, and we shall introduce you to the cruelest torture known to man!" 
- Dialog: (120071)"Aaaah!" a voice of pain cried out in the darkness. He coiled his body as he endured the searing pain.

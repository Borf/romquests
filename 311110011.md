- Dialog: (120032)So, today let's talk about the Hand of the Shadows: Ysmir!
- Dialog: (120033)The bright, shining runes gradually faded and the stone altar emitted a weak light. 
- Dialog: (120034)She slowly opened her eyes and got off the stone slab. She felt the power flowing through her body, like a bucking stallion running through her veins. 
- Dialog: (120035)With power from the ruins of Morroc's Assassins Guild, she was more powerful than anyone. 
- Dialog: (120036)An idea flashed through her mind, and refused to be cast aside. It cried, "It is time to let out the pain that you hold inside!"
- Dialog: (120037)The demon from Hell, wrapped in blood and fire, jeered her; "Weakling! You have no right to survive!"
- Dialog: (120038)That night, filled with tears and terror, she watched with frightened eyes as those in front of her died, one after another. 
- Dialog: (120039)The demon known as Count Dracula wantonly killed her family. She had hidden under her bed, not daring to make a sound, as the fires of vengeance grew in her heart.
- Dialog: (120040)That's all I have to say for now. Adventurer, I need some [c][ffff00]Leaf of Yggdrasil[-][/c]. Can you get them for me?  - Options: I'll go right now.

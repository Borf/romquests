- Dialog: (120468)Today, I will tell you the story of Morgan.
- Dialog: (120469)He was believed by Geffen's school of magic to be a "dunce, " but he knew that his gifts were inferior to no one's. 
- Dialog: (120470)Since he knew his skills to match anyone's, Morgan was confident he would not lose to anyone. 
- Dialog: (120471)But Morgan was not a rigorous student, and couldn't be bothered to explain himself, so his ill repute spread throughout Geffen.
- Dialog: (120472)Morgan's family was known to carry ancient magic in their veins, which just didn't fit into Geffen's magic system.
- Dialog: (120473)He chose to give up studying magic, and to go around the land studying magic that had been passed down instead.
- Dialog: (120474)After obtaining some skills, he came to the Mjolnir Mountains, where he challenged the powerful Mistress.
- Dialog: (120475)It was obvious that the Mistress could do nothing to harm him.
- Dialog: (120476)Let me pause the story for now. Can you buy me a record called [c][ffff00]I Miss You[-][/c]?

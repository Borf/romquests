- Dialog: (3878)My name is Ray. I'm a [c][ffff00]Monster Scholar[-][/c] from the Midgards continent. I don't believe we've met before.
- Dialog: (3879)In the early days, scholars distinguished monsters by the [c][ffff00]Jellopy[-][/c] which is a special organization discovered amongst monsters. Our [c][ffff00]Monster Research Center[-][/c] has been studying the Jellopy for a very long time.
- Dialog: (3880)However, our recently discovered monsters are way stronger than before and their body doesn't contain the Jellopy. This is a very important discovery.
- Dialog: (3895)We've been working on a countermeasure to cope with the [c][ffff00]Jellopy[-][/c]. However, as far as we know now, we won't be able to wipe out all the monsters even if we find it.
- Dialog: (3896)No matter what, the [c][ffff00]Jellopy Crystal[-][/c] certainly fuels the monster's inherent aptitude. Now, I plan to prove this conjecture through one experiment. Adventurer, could you help me gather some [c][ffff00]Jellopy[-][/c]? - Options: {Sure,0}{Not interested,9}

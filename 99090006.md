- Dialog: (503430)A guild is a meeting place of unity, courage, and friendliness. Like-minded adventurers join the same guild to work towards a common goal.
- Dialog: (503431)At the same time, it gives adventurers another possibility to explore the world! While adventuring solo is certainly fun, the power of guilds allows you to experience an even different kind of adventurous life. Pick a guild you like to join if you're interested!

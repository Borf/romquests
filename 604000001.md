- Dialog: (485196)The cavern ahead is the Falling Star Cave, which, however, is a forbidden area of the Meteor Forest. And we're not allowed to go inside unless we have the Master's Order.
- Dialog: (485197)I wonder what secret could be in there... That cave is said to be created by a meteor crash. Could some kind of alien secret treasure be in it?
- Dialog: (485198)Or, there might be a treasure that can strengthen people? I'm so curious!

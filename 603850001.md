- Dialog: (8976)So, let me introduce you to the exchange. The exchange uses Zeny to trade, and the exchange prices are set by our appraisers. Of course, we will raise or lower the price accordingly based on the actual trade. 
- Dialog: (8977)The exchange takes a certain fee for items that are put up for trade. Once the trade is successful, a certain amount of trade tax will be collected. If the item hasn't been sold within 24 hours, it will expire, and be returned to the seller.  - Options: I understand

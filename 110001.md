- Dialog: (96679)Only with the legendary "Essence of the Sea" could we properly repair the seal, but no one has ever truly seen what the "Essence of the Sea" looks like. All I can do right now is temporarily stabilize the situation here and repair the two mirror points to maintain the seal's integrity.
- Dialog: (96680)We need to keep studying how to repair the seal here. Codexes have recorded that tributes must be sacrificed to make use of Strouf's power. It seems we must first [c][ffff00]collect some tributes that were eaten by Vadon[-][/c]. [c][ffff00][PlayerName][-][/c], can you help?  - Options: No problem!

- Dialog: (81962)A building of this style... I don't think I've ever seen anything similar. - Options: A bit strange?
- Dialog: (81963)Very! Look at that mottled clock, the well-proportioned stone stairs, and the wooden columns.
- Dialog: (81964)Have you seen it anywhere else? - Options: That's true.
- Dialog: (81965)As a historical researcher, I'm very interested in this kind of stuff.
- Dialog: (81966)Broken city walls, Dead trees, and the half built altar are telling us one thing! This city sank into the ground over one night.
- Dialog: (81967)According to my brief observation of these ancient objects here, I believe the city has been buried for at least five centuries.
- Dialog: (81968)Shocking, right? Was it a natural calamity? If it was a man-made misfortune... How powerful he must be to bury an entire city! He is pretty much a god!
- Dialog: (81969)This place is full of Nine Tails and Dokebis. Plus the rumors about ghosts... There must be some secret hidden here! - Options: What secret?
- Dialog: (81970)I don't know yet but one day I'll restore the entire history completely!

- Dialog: (82252)I am so confident in the strength of our mercenaries that each adventurer can only hire a maximum of four mercenaries. Trust me and the abilities of them four. They will be a match for an elite troop!
- Dialog: (82253)To meet the employer's need in battle, an adventurer of a higher level will be assigned a mercenary of a higher level.
- Dialog: (82254)If a mercenary is injured fatally, he will return to recover. Once his wound heals, he'll rejoin the battle immediately.
- Dialog: (82255)I'd like to point out that one mercenary will take up one position in your Party. If an adventurer is in the grouped status and the adventurers and their mercenaries together are beyond the upper limit of the Party, Mercenaries will leave the Party automatically.
- Dialog: (82256)Of course if a Party has places available, adventurers can call their mercenaries back to join the Party.

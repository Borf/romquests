- Dialog: (9602)The Ugarte family uses ordinary materials that can't normally be magically enhanced to create weapons and armor. This solves the issue of normal materials not being able to hold magic, and allows these weapons and equipment to be enchanted. 
- Dialog: (9603)Hayward uses rare magical materials and enchantments to smith. To put it simply, he uses a technique of simultaneous smithing and enchanting. We call it "Enchantment Smithing." 
- Dialog: (9604)Our family's achievements in this area have earned Hayward's praise as well. He has called our family the best smithing family in the land. 
- Dialog: (9605)Our family's techniques are based on the smithing scroll from the dwarf. These techniques have evolved through research over generations. In the dwarf's smithing scroll, the materials of weapons and armor are incomparably precious, using things like World Tree branches, Star Iron, which never rust.
- Dialog: (9606)Only by adding rune engraving magic unique to dwarves can one create powerful weapons fit for the gods. Humans can't find such precious materials.
- Dialog: (9607)Through our research, the Ugarte family has found ways to use ordinary iron and steel to forge outstanding weapons.
- Dialog: (9608)They use normal materials to create weapons that are incomparably sharp and rarely break. Their family techniques are used to create weapons that can be enchanted, refined, and upgraded in other ways.
- Dialog: (9609)Hollgrehenn, the refining master himself, once said that Ugarte weapons are the best weapon for refining.
- Dialog: (9610)"Weapons and armor that can grow" represents the smithing techniques of the Ugarte family.

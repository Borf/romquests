- Dialog: (120356)Today, I will tell you the story about Lavure, the Mages of Riddles.
- Dialog: (120357)The light of magic shall grace the land--Lavure.
- Dialog: (120358)Eight years ago, Geffen welcomed a strange mage, who rented a small room in the city. 
- Dialog: (120359)Nobody knew what he did inside. The Geffen Mage Guild attempted to contact this strange person, but was met only with Lavure's cold laughter.
- Dialog: (120360)The people of the Mage Guild were furious. They swore to run Lavure out of Geffen, but the head of the Mage Guild advised them to leave the matter unsettled.
- Dialog: (120361)Lavure became the most unpopular person in Geffen in a century, but he paid it no mind, Or perhaps didn't care at all.
- Dialog: (120362)In his words, "What concerns does the dragon have of the mouse?" 
- Dialog: (120363)He remained in his room, and as time passed on, the people of Geffen forgot about his existence.
- Dialog: (120364)This story isn't one you can hear so easily. Go buy a [c][ffff00]Mace[-][/c] for me, will you?

- Dialog: (96689)It seems that we need some elements to strengthen the energy of the enchantment to help maintain the seal. Thankfully, I've brought some magic ore with me, but it can only be used for spells when mixed. I've got it! [c][ffff00]Marinas drop their tentacles[-][/c], and can be used as mixture materials. Can you help me collect some?  - Options: Of course!

- Dialog: (83456)By the way, through my long observation in the Ant Hell, I have come to one conclusion. Can you see those white ant eggs scattered all over the place? Sometimes, Deniro★s would come out of these eggs.
- Dialog: (83552)They are not the same with the regular Deniros. They are very rich. The topaz I need can be easily obtained from them. Give it a try. Don't say I didn't warn you. These Deniro★s are very aggressive. Three of them together would be more than enough to cause you trouble.
